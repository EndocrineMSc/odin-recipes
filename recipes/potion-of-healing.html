        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A typical, weak healing potion. Very little and inexpensive ingredients are needed for this potion.
        </p>
        <p>
            If brewed correctly, it will heal minor wounds, such as scrapes on the knee, mild headaches or a bite of
            a small animal.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The consistency should be slightly viscous but still watery. The final color should be a bright red.
        </p>

            We don't talk about the taste.

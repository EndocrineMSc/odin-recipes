    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This smelly potion gives you the ability to float upwards. Be aware that your positioning is very important
        with using this potion, as you can only float up and down and have no way to change directions mid-air!
    </p>
    <p>
        This complex potion requires several intermediate ingredients and smells like rotten eggs due to the usage of
        sulphur shelf in the recipe. Luckily it only tastes half as bad as it smells - still not good though.
    </p>
    <p>
        If brewed correctly, the contents of this potion should float directly below the stopper, instead of gathering
        at the bottom of the flask, as you would expect.
    </p>
